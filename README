Windows Instructions:
1a) (Optional): Install Linux or OS X and proceed with above instructions. Windows is one giant pain in the ass for software development.
1) Install GitExtensions
	*It includes Git, MySYSGit, and KDiff you'll need all three.
2) Choose a compiler
	*We require at least a Visual C++ 2013 compiler or greater.
	*You're welcome to use another compiler as long as C++11 is supported.
3) Install .NET Framework 3.5, 4,0, and 4.5
4) Install CMake
5) Install OpenSSL Binaries x86 and x64(If you have a 64bit machine).
	*DO NOT INSTALL THE LIGHT BINARIES, GET THE FULL BINARIES
	*SECURITY WARNING: Due to heartbleed make sure to install a version of OpenSSL >=1.0.1g
	*Note #1: If you have a "Missing Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables" error message while installing OpenSSL, find the Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables download (1.7MB Installer) in the same list where OpenSSL is located and install it. The Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables (x64) is for 64bit. Also note that there are two "Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables" download links. They are both the same.
	*Note #2: While installing OpenSSL, choose The OpenSSL binaries (/bin) directory (NOT "The Windows system directory") when given the choice on where to copy the OpenSSL DLLs. These DLLs will need to be located easily for Compiling the Source.
6) Install BOOST
	a) Download boost source code for Windows from their website, you'll need version 1.55.0
	b) Find a suitable location to extract the sourecode to. Find a place you won't touch or change.
	c) When you unzip make sure you get the whole directory
	c) Remember this location.
7) Launch CMake GUI and set the source code section to the tumors folder where CMakeLists.txt is found.
7a) Set the build binaries location to someplace you want the binaries and Visual Studio project files to be.
8) Click Configure
9) Look for any red text, you'll likely see a warning pop up about BOOST. Select the "Advanced" checkmark and find Boost_INCLUDE_DIR.
9a) Set the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR to point to where you extracted the BOOST files earlier in step 6c.
10) Select configure again and all warnings should be gone.
11) Select generate and if all goes well you should have a Visual Studio project file in the location of where you set "Build the Binaries" to.
